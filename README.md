![Neuro_Snake Demo](assets/demo.gif)


Neuro_Snake is an AI-enhanced implementation of the classic Snake game, using Deep-Q-Network Learning. The agent uses a neural network to learn optimal strategies for navigating the grid, collecting food, and avoiding collisions. With continuous training, the model improves its decision-making by minimizing loss and maximizing cumulative rewards.
